This paper develops a fast two-stage framework for Surface-form-gradients (SfG) problem using data-driven neural operator. Especially, the network part can be integrated into other deep learning system to perform numeraical integration if reasonably modified.
 

## Get started



## Train


## Test on LUCES dataset

## Test on DiLiGenT dataset


## Test on our Real (or your own) Dataset

Run

We upload one sample for testing. If you want to test on your own data, please modify the code in "datasets/real_dataset.py" according to annotations.


## Issue

Please feel free to report! Any suggestions are welcomed.
